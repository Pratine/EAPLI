Analysis - UC - Cafeteria Shutdown

When the day is over the kitchen manager will 
collect data about the specific amount of wasted meals
and will inform the system about it.
After that the kitchen manager will shutdown 
the cafeteria so that no more operations can be done
on the given day.

The CafeteriaShift will have a CafeteriaShiftState
attribute. The CafeteriaShiftState can be "open" 
or "closed". Once the kitchen manager shuts down
the cafeteria, the state will be changed to "closed".
